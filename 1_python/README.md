# Python

## Web Scraping Application

In this project I will be devloping a Python-based web-scraping application using BeautifulSoup and requests to navigate and extract structured data from a website.

For this project I will be scraping data from `maisgasolina.com`, a website which tracks the gas prices in Portugal, keep in mind that if you're running this project anytime after it has been developed it may not be working properly.

## Getting Started

To run this project successfully you will need to have Python 3x installed on your machine (this project was developed using Python 3.11.4, so no retro-compatibility is assured).
The next step is to create a virtual environment or install directly the required python modules into your global python installation.

To create a virtual environment you must run `python3 -m venv .venv`. Switching to the environment depends on the shell you're using, so if you do not know how to do it I suggest searching beforehand.

To install the required modules use `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After the environment is correctly setup, use `python3 run.py` to run the application.
