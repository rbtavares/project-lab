## Introduction

Welcome to the Project Lab, this collection consists of 10 small projects designed to help me expand my knowledge and usage of various programming languages. The motivation behind this endeavor is to gain practical experience in different languages and their unique features, enhancing my versatility as a programmer.

## Project Ideas

Each project idea is tailored to showcase the strengths and main characteristics of the programming language used. These project ideas were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT.

## Project List

1. **Python: Web Scraping Application**
   - Develop a Python-based web-scraping application using BeautifulSoup and requests to navigate and extract structured data from various websites.

2. **Java: Library Management System**
   - Create a Library Management System in Java, emphasizing object-oriented design principles. Use classes to model books, patrons, and library operations.

3. **C++: Game Development - Tic Tac Toe**
   - Dive into C++ game development by crafting a console-based Tic Tac Toe game, implementing the game logic to handle moves, determine a winner, and manage the overall gaming experience.

4. **C: File Compression Utility**
   - Leverage C's low-level features to build a file compression utility, exploring perhaps file I/O operations, bitwise manipulation, and algorithmic strategies for efficient compression and decompression of files.

5. **JavaScript: To-Do List Application**
   - Construct a dynamic To-Do List application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Implement features such as task creation, deletion, and marking tasks as complete.

6. **Rust: Command-Line Tool for File Operations**
   - Experience the safety and performance of Rust by creating a command-line tool for file operations, utilizing Rust's ownership system to manage resources and implement file-related functionalities.

7. **Go: RESTful API Server**
   - Develop a RESTful API server in Go, leveraging the simplicity and efficiency of the language, define RESTful endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and interact with a database.

8. **TypeScript: Weather App with React**
   - Combine TypeScript and React to build a weather application, fetching weather data from a public API and dynamically update the UI with React components.

9. **HTML (Front-end Design Focused): Personal Portfolio Website**
   - Create a personalized portfolio website using HTML and CSS. Showcase skills, projects, and achievements with a clean and responsive design. Include sections for a bio, resume, and project gallery.

10. **Ruby: Blogging Platform**
    - Develop a Pomodoro Timer application using Ruby. Users can set timers for work intervals (Pomodoros) and breaks. Implement features such as customizable timer durations, notifications, and a log to track completed Pomodoros. (command-line interface or a basic web application for interaction).

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore each project individually. Each project directory contains a README with specific instructions on setting up and running the project as well as some other details relevant for each project. These projects will be worked on gradually, so by time you're visiting this repository, some projects may be incomplete or have not been started yet.
